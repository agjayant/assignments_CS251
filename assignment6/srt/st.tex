\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar} is a former Indian cricketer and captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He took cricket \index{cricket} at the age of eleven, made his Test \index{Test} debut \index{debut} on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international \index{centuries} centuries, the first \index{batsmen} batsman to score a double century in a \index{One Day International} One Day International, holds the \index{record} record for most number of \index{runs} runs in both ODI and \index{Test} Test cricket, the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. \cite{wiki} \\

There are so many things that Sachin Tendulkar is to so many people, that it is sometimes forgotten that he is first and foremost a batsman of unparalleled ability, dedication and mind. If he had taken to some other sport in early childhood, his persona would have been invented -- by coaches who want to teach their wards the virtues a tight technique that allows attacking shots, by film-makers who want to create celluloid fantasy by depicting the perfect batsman and superstar, by marketing men who want to appeal to the broadest strata of public imaginable and by cricket fanatics who want to see batting perfection embodied in one person. \cite{cric} \\ 

\section{Captaincy}
Tendulkar's two \index{tenures} as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as \index{captain} in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the \index{team} was performing poorly.
Table \ref{table:cap} shows his captaincy stint.

\section{Playing Style}
Sachin's batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary \index{movements} movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.He is known for his unique \index{punch} punch style of hitting the ball over \index{square} square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect \index{straight} straight \index{drive} drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.
Figure 2 shows how he favours the covers and mid-wicket region the most. \\
